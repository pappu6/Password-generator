# Contributing
The purpose of this project is to be an intro into open source for any beginners so you can go through the project site here [Random Password Generator](https://jemimaabu.github.io/random-password-generator/) and then choose something to work on.

I made the project as bare as possible so there should be many things to choose from (styling a button or optimizing the logic or whatever).

## Getting Started
**Step 1**:  Create an issue for the task you want to work on (go through the [Issues](https://github.com/jemimaabu/random-password-generator/issues) page first to make sure it doesn't already exist) or select an already existing issue to work on.

**Step 2**: Assign the issue to yourself or leave a comment under an existing issue, requesting assignment.

**Step 3**: Fork the repository, create a new branch with the same title as your issue (as long as it's something readable) and make whatever changes you want.

**Step 4**: Create a pull request for the branch.

**Step 5**: Once your PR is approved and merged, the change will be uploaded to the project website.

**Step 6**: Congratulations, you've just contributed to an Open Source Project! Whoopwhoop.
